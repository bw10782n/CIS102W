        <p align= "center"> Rave culture is something that is overlooked as an event where everyone is tripping off drugs. There are actually some pretty talented DJs/artists who mix up some heavy bass or techno tracks paired along with some amazing lazers and visuals. I believe it is truly a work of art, even minus the whole drug stigma. I have attached a picture of one of Excision's sets, he is one of my favorite EDM artists and his visuals are beyond astounding.</p>
